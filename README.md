## Features

- **Dynamic Creative Tab**:  
  A new creative inventory tab named **"ยง9Limitless"** dynamically displays unique items equipped by players.

- **Real-Time Updates**:  
  Items are added to the tab as players equip them, ensuring that the tab stays fresh and updated.

- **No Duplicates**:  
  Uses advanced tracking to prevent duplicate items from cluttering the creative tab.

- **Creative Tab Refresh**:  
  Automatically refreshes the creative inventory when new items are added, providing a seamless experience.

## How It Works

1. **Tracking Equipped Items**:  
   The mod listens for equipment updates (`EntityEquipmentUpdateS2CPacket`) and adds unique equipped items to the `Limitless` creative tab.

2. **Preventing Duplicates**:  
   Items are identified using a combination of their type and NBT data, ensuring only unique items are displayed.

3. **Creative Tab Integration**:  
   When new items are detected, the creative tab refreshes automatically to reflect the updates.
